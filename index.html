          <h2 class="card__title">Games</h2>
          <p class="card__text">Video games have been a part of my life for as 
            long as I can remember. To me, gaming is the ultimate art form: a 
            combination of illustration, music, design, and technology all 
            brought to life. I have watched video games change so much over 
            the last few decades and hope to become a part of bringing new 
            gaming experiences to future generations.</p>

          <h2 class="card__title">Cats</h2>
          <p class="card__text">Growing up, I was a dog person. I’m still a 
            dog person, but now I’m a cat person, too. I adopted littermates 
            Clover and Noire in 2018 and they have been my sidekicks ever since. 
            Whenever I’m coding, more often than not, they are laying at my 
            feet or on the desk with me. My cats have been my warm, fuzzy 
            support system and help make my house a home.</p>

          <h2 class="card__title">Music</h2>
          <p class="card__text">At any given point in the day, there’s a song
             in my head. I can’t help it– if I’m out in public, I’m the friend 
             pointing out that the restaurant is playing a cover of an obscure 
             90’s song I know, while others didn’t even realize music was 
             playing. I love picking apart my favorite tracks and listening to
              each instrument layer on its own, appreciating new subtleties 
              every time.</p>

          <h2 class="card__title">Nursing</h2>
          <p class="card__text">My first career was nursing, with pediatrics as 
            my specialty. Nursing gave me an opportunity to become a small part 
            of the lives of thousands and patients and families. I have had the 
            privilege of caring for people from birth until death. The 
            experiences I have had as a nurse have made me realize what is 
            really important in life and help shape who I am today.</p>
